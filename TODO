//TODO

* Make sure that ALL special characters are able to inputted (or restricted) into the appropriate label.  I.E., whitespace and underscore for project title.
* There are some redundancies with the if-else statements in the title window while loop, need to combine a few of these.
* Fix tuning issues - Input doesn't allow user to enter one letter only (i.e. without accidentals), it simply moves back to the skipped space, inputs the letter 
  and locks down.  Also doesn't allow an accidental on eighth string when using an 8 string mode.  Need to also allow users to input lower case characters in 
  the first slot, where they will be replaced by the upper case value.
* Also need to ensure that user has entered a proper tuning for the number of strings declared.
* Ensure that label arrays are filling properly and print to the header when the "OK" button is pressed.  The "CANCEL" button should leave the defaults where they are.
* Need to set the proper x-values whenever the user decides to edit the header data.
* Fix the "Tabbed by" and "Email" labels on the header.  They should have some more sensible default values than what they have now.
* Create a "mutt-like" event bar down at the bottom.  Should display any error messages, total tab length, current line number and have a "vim-like" input mode for 
  things like bringing up the title window to edit header labels, saving the file to whatever database I'll have to cook up and possibly exporting to a text file, etc...
* Also have a help option that shows default key-mappings
* Screen should have the ability to scroll, but only if user has inputted enough data.
* Need a database that saves and loads a previous tab.  Would like to have a menu select window and possibly have a command line option that opens a tab by name.
* The ability to add comments to the top of a staff would be cool as well.
